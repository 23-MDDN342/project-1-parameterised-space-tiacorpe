### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

21/3/2023
Forgot to commit this last session. Have got most of the unrefined movements on the page, though still a couple glitches in those to sort out. Am fairly happy with the composition at the moment but will likely make more tweaks as I further refine things. Currently have a little room on the far right side to add more elements in, but I'm not 100% sure what I want those to be at the moment.
