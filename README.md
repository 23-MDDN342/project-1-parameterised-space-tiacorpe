### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

22/3/2023
Majority of my key elements are on the page now. At this stage I just need to finalise the colour scheme and potentially add a couple more movements and/or tweak some. Theres some space in the middle which I had some ideas for, so might incorperate that. I also adjusted the buffer as shown in class which I think really helped how things look.
