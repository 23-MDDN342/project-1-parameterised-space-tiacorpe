### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

9/3/2023
Still in the very early stages and largely just trying to focus on the movements of certain elements. I got the cog shape with the help of ChatGPT. For the rotation, I'm still experimenting with the rotation rate to make things loop nicely! Also trying to figure out the best placements of the cogs in regards to each other still. Colours are not at all finalised, but I was sick of looking at B & W. :)
