### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

23/3/2023
Finished all the moving elements on the page. Also did some readjusting of the layers and strokes to get a more detailed look - in the triangles and the multiple ellipses in particular, I think this made a big difference. I spent some time cleaning up the code as well and making sure everything was working in regards to the width/height (noticed this was an issue with the stroke weight in the larger screen sizes). The colour palette I'm still a little torn on, as the overall composition isn't feeling too busy that brighter colours would be overwheming. I'm currently using 5 colours so I'll go from there - for now, the purple and gold is nice to look at.
