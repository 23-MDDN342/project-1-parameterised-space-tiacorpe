### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

SHUFFLING SHAPES by Tia Corpe.
This looping animation sketch was produced in p5.js, and intended to be used as a Zoom background. It is set to be viewed at various scales.
Inspired by geometric shapes and patterns, the aim for Shuffling Shapes was to have multiple moving elements on the page that were not too overwhelming on the eyes. In combination with the bright, complimenting colour palette, the animation shows several different movements in different sizes and shapes.
