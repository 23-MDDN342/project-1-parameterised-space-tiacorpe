### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

16/3/2023
After starting from scratch I've started experimenting with some shapes. Using the easing example as a foundation I've added in some rectangles. Still need to adjust them so they don't bounce at the end but remain moving at different times - will likely also change there size/position on the canvas to fit more stuff in.
