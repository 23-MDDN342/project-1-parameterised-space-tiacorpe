5/3/2023
Still in the very early stages and just getting used to working in regards to height and width. Going with a geometric design with clocks but just trying to get shapes on the page at this stage. Also having trouble as VS code isn't auto-completing the p5.js code, so will most likely fix that before moving any further.
