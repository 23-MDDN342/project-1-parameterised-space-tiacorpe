### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

24/3/2023
Have finalised my colour palette; I'm going with a blue with gold accents look. I quite like these colours, hopefully they're not too overwhelming to the eye, but I imagine if there was a person on zoom infront of the bulk of this it actually wouldn't be as bad/harsh on the eye. I also further adjusted the sliding blocks, adding in a couple more to create a bit of a staggered effect which I'm happy with. Now just finishing the remaining documentation + the final README.md, which will be on a seperate commit.
